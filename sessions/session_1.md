# Session 1

## Goals for this session

- Set up the development tools
- Build a microservice that ingests live trades from Kraken and push them to a Kafka topic
## Tools

### 1. Code editor
My recommendations are
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

but feel free to use whatever editor you fell in love with.

### 2. Python >= 3.10

### 3. `uv`
We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to package our Python code.

No more `pip` installs, `venv` activations or `poetry run`s. `uv` is a tool that does everything these tools do. But faster.

### 4. Docker and Docker Compose
We use Docker to run services and infrastructure locally, and docker compose to manage stacks of docker services using `.yml` files.

Advice
If you are a windows user, I recommend you install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
Installation is as simple as opening your PowerShell and running
```powershell
wsl --install
```

### 5. `make` tool

Makefiles help Python projects by:

* Standardizing common commands (test, lint, build)
* Chaining multiple commands together
* Managing dependencies between tasks
* Providing a consistent interface across environments
* Automating repetitive development tasks

Installation
- Mac
    ```
    xcode-select --install
    ```

- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install make
    ```
    
- Windows (using WSL)
    ```
    wsl --install -d Ubuntu
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install make
    ```
